SmartProfile 1.03-MB02

This is an edited version of SmartProfile 1.03 with many 
fixes for issues that weren't working.

To install, put the 'smartprofile' directory in the modules 
directory and then install normally. If you want to redirect 
the previous pages, then copy the extras files except for 
pmlite.php.

If you want to change the PM (private message) to send via 
e-mail instead of the on-site PM, then load the pmlite.php 
and language files over your existing ones (or integrate if 
you've made changes).
